# Optical Garage System

## Overview

The **Optical Garage System** is a smart, educational parking automation project that integrates embedded systems, secure communication, and mechanical design. This project allows vehicles to enter and exit a dual-gate garage using laser-based encrypted communication for authentication.

## Features

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega328P (Arduino-compatible)
- **Communication**: Encrypted laser-based link between vehicle (TX) and garage (RX)
- **Gate Control**: Dual-gate system (entry and exit) operated by servo motors
- **Secure Access**: Only authorized vehicles can open gates
- **Vehicle Monitoring**: Status reporting and problem detection via laser signals
- **Power Efficiency**: Low-power operation for energy-saving
- **Educational Design**: Modular wooden structure designed in Fusion 360
- **Integration-Ready**: Compatible with Arduino, STM32, and other microcontroller platforms

## System Capabilities

- Automatic gate opening/closing based on authenticated laser signal
- Real-time vehicle presence detection and logging
- Encrypted communication for security
- Fault detection and reporting from the car to the garage controller
- Hands-on learning in embedded systems, mechatronics, and IoT

## Components Used

- ATmega328P Microcontroller
- Laser TX and RX Modules
- Servo Motors (for gates)
- 2x16 LCD Display
- Custom-designed wooden hardware kit
- 5V Power Supply

## Mechanical Design

- Developed using **Fusion 360**
- Built from wood for easy educational assembly
- Includes two gates: one for entry and one for exit

## Educational Goals

This project is designed to help students and hobbyists:
- Understand embedded systems and microcontroller interfacing
- Explore secure optical communication
- Learn real-time control logic and system integration
- Engage in hands-on hardware and software development
